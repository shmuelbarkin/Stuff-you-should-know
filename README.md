# Stuff you should know

## Objective
This objective of this project is to provide a list of basic development concepts geared towards beginning developers. These are listed below.
I have also included some other useful resources, such as - common command line commands, issue templates, website checklist and more. Those are presented as additional files in this repo. 

## Repo structure
This repo contains resources for the development process end to end. To we have used a prefix to identify which part of the process it belongs to.
- dev => development
- projectManagement => projectManagement 
- design = design and UX/UI
*Often there is an overlap, so these classifications are the closest match to the contents according to my understanding.*
